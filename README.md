This is an assignment to create a filter view for a database using javascript and html.

The code provides a webpage that loads 111 ufo sightings from a database, then allows you to filter by various attributes and renders a filtered table of sightings data:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

Deleting or reloading the page will reset the filter.
